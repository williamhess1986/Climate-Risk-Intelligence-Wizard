Climate Risk Intelligence Wizard
What this project does

This project explores how public data can be used to understand compound climate risk — not just individual hazards, but how multiple stresses combine to push real-world systems toward failure thresholds.

Instead of treating risks like isolated map layers, the system models:

environmental drivers

system strain and capacity limits

institutional response

cascading secondary effects

Why this matters

We already know many climate risks are coming. The challenge is not awareness — it’s adaptation.

Most existing tools show hazards individually, while real-world impacts happen when multiple stresses interact and overwhelm infrastructure, housing, and governance systems.

This project focuses on interpreting those interactions.

Current status

This repository contains the application backbone and reasoning framework.
It is not yet connected to live datasets.

The goal is to provide a foundation that others can extend with real public data integrations.
